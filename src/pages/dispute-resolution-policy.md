            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
            <p><b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b>Buyers and Sellers</b>. For purposes of this Dispute Policy, the term "Seller" means the registered user who offers a Product for sale on the Site in the form of a Listing; and the term "Buyer" means the registered user who agrees to purchase or acquire a Product offered for sale on the Site.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b>Seller Responsibilities</b>. As a Seller, you are solely responsible for the accuracy and completeness of your Listing and information necessary for a Buyer to purchase Products from you. If a Buyer accepts the terms contained in your Listing, you may not alter those terms after acceptance unless expressly agreed upon by the Buyer.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b>Buyer Responsibilities</b>. As a Buyer, you are solely responsible for reading and understanding all terms and conditions contained in a Listing and asking questions about a Seller's Listing or Product if such terms are unclear or incomplete. If you accept the terms contained in a Listing, you are agreeing to purchase the Product contained in the Listing on the terms contained in the Listing without modification or reservation.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b>Negotiated Terms</b>. A Buyer and Seller may alter the terms contained in a Listing upon mutual written agreement. Modifications to the terms contained in a listing shall not be binding on a Buyer or Seller unless both parties have accepted the modified terms in writing using the messaging features provided through the Site. Once a Buyer and Seller have reached an agreement on a particular Listing, a binding contract is formed and each party is responsible for complying with its respective duties and obligations (the "Final Terms").</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b>Initiating a Claim</b>. If you believe that a party with which you have entered into an agreement for the purchase or sale of a Product on the Site has breached any of the Final Terms, including but not limited to those concerning the Grade, quantity, location, or delivery, you may submit a claim using merQbiz's claim-initiation form available on the Site (a "Claim"). You may submit a Claim within three (3) days of delivery of the Product. Any Claim that is submitted after such three-day period will be rejected.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b>Claim Procedure</b>.&nbsp; Once you have submitted a Claim, merQbiz will log the claim in its Claim system and notify the other party subject to the Claim on the next business day (a "Claim Notice"). The recipient of a Claim Notice (the&nbsp;"Recipient") will have a period of three (3) business days to accept or reject the claim by contacting you using the messaging features provided through the Site.&nbsp; If the Recipient does not accept or reject the Claim during such three-day period, the Claim will be deemed rejected.&nbsp; If a Claim is rejected, either party may request that merQbiz arrange a telephone conference between the parties at a mutually acceptable time for the purpose of facilitating a resolution.&nbsp; A merQbiz representative will be present on the telephone conference, but in no event will merQbiz act as arbiter or otherwise participate in discussions to resolve the Claim.&nbsp; You acknowledge and agree that merQbiz has the right to (i) record any such telephone conferences and (ii) suspend or terminate your account, or downgrade your User Rating, if you fail to attend a scheduled telephone conference without prior notice or otherwise fail to cooperate in good faith.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b>Resolution of Claim; Remedies</b>.&nbsp; If a Claim is resolved, whether by the Recipient accepting the Claim following receipt of the Claim Notice or through participation in the telephone conference, both parties are expected to promptly comply with the terms of the resolution, including any agreed upon refunds, returns or adjustments.&nbsp; If the Recipient does not comply with the terms of the resolution, or if your Claim remains unresolved, you may pursue all remedies against the Recipient that may be available under applicable law.&nbsp; Because merQbiz is not directly involved in a Transaction between individual Buyers and Sellers, merQbiz is unable to issue refunds, remove defective or damaged Products, or take other steps to resolve a Claim.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b>Release of merQbiz</b>. You acknowledge and agree that (a) merQbiz does not take title to or possession of any Product being sold on the Site and (b) merQbiz is neither a party to any Online Transaction nor your agent or an agent of any Seller or Buyer in any Online Transaction. In the event of a dispute arising from an Online Transaction, INCLUDING ANY CLAIM, you hereby release merQbiz, its directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all claims, demands and damages (actual, special, incidental and consequential, and including attorneys' fees) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such dispute. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."</p>
